Simple demonstration of plotting HIBC routes on a map using the Google Maps API and the JSON routes from RideWithGPS.

gethibcroutes.py is a python script that queries RidewithGPS for a list of all routes owned by the HIBC group.  It then downloads a local copy of the JSON for each route.

Work in progress.
